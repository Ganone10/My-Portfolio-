                This project, we aim to design a portfolio investment strategy focusing on CAC40 stocks. The primary objective is to construct a benchmark portfolio based on the market capitalization of these stocks. Subsequently, we will explore more advanced strategies in a later part of the project.

                - **Data Analysis:** Perform historical statistical analysis of CAC40 stocks' performance, with a focus on key financial ratios, market trends, and volatility metrics. This analysis will serve as a comprehensive introduction to portfolio management and provide insights into risk-return frameworks, such as the Value at Risk (VaR) and Risk-Reward (Sharpe Ratio), laying the foundation for advanced portfolio strategies.
                - **Sample Datasets:** Access sample datasets containing historical data for CAC40 stocks, allowing users to explore key financial indicators and test portfolio management strategies without requiring their own data..

                **Description:**
                This ongoing project aims to develop an interactive credit analysis dashboard using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. The dashboard will provide users with the ability to explore and visualize key financial and credit ratios of publicly traded companies, alongside performing Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) simulations for growth projections. The goal is to offer insights into both creditworthiness and company valuation, helping to support more informed credit decision-making.
                - **Data Visualization:** The dashboard will feature interactive charts and visualizations, built with **Streamlit**, to display financial metrics such as **Debt-to-Equity ratio**, **Interest Coverage ratio**, and other credit-related indicators. Users will be able to customize views for deeper analysis.
                - **User Interaction:** The platform will support dynamic user interaction through various widgets, such as **sliders**, **dropdown menus**, **buttons**, and **text inputs**, enabling customization of data visualization and analysis parameters, including adjusting assumptions for the DCF model.
                - **Integration with DCF Simulation Model:** A **DCF simulation model** will be integrated into the platform, allowing users to model future growth and project a company's value based on input parameters. This feature will allow for scenario analysis and understanding the impact of different assumptions on credit evaluation.
                - **Real-Time Financial Analysis:** Users will be able to explore and analyze **live** or **historical financial data** of public stocks, assessing a companyâ€™s financial health using up-to-date financial statements and relevant credit ratios.
                - **Deployment:** The application will be easily deployable as a web app using **Streamlit's built-in deployment options** or other cloud platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Azure** for broader accessibility.
